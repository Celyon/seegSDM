# seegSDM
## Streamlined Functions for Species Distribution Modelling in the [SEEG Research Group][1].

This package contains a set of streamlined functions to fit species distribution models.
The current focus is on the ensemble BRT approaches used in the recent [Bhatt et al. dengue paper][2].
The package is intended to help members of the research group to fit these and similar models, and to let other researchers scrutinise the methodology in detail.
This package is not designed to be used more widely - of course you're welcome to use it and we hope it's helpful, but maintaining it and making it user-friendly is not a major focus.


### Installation

You can install the package from GitHub using [`devtools`][3]:

```r
devtools::install_github('SEEG-Oxford/seegSDM')
```

### Reporting bugs

Please report bugs, issues and suggestions for extra functions using the [issues tracker](https://github.com/SEEG-Oxford/seegSDM/issues).


### Tutorial

There is the beginnings of a tutorial/example workflow for the package [here](https://rawgithub.com/SEEG-Oxford/seegSDM/master/seegSDM_tutorial.html)
